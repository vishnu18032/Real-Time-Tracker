# Real-Time-Tracker


- Overview
  The project utilizes web technologies to create a real-time location tracking system where multiple users can track each other's locations on a map. It includes a client-side           interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Leaflet for mapping and Socket.IO for real-time communication), and a server-side built with Node.js and Express.

- Features
  ->  Real-Time Updates: Receive instant location updates from connected clients.
  ->  Interactive Map: Use Leaflet to visualize and interact with the map.
  ->  Scalable Architecture: Utilize Socket.IO for efficient real-time communication handling.

-  Installation
  1.  Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-tracker.git
        cd real-time-tracker

  2.  Install dependencies:
        npm install

  3.  Install Nodemon
        npm install nodemon --save-dev

  5.  Start the server:
